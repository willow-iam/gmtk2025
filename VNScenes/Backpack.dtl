- Business Card | [if {inventory.bizcard}]
	“Martian Mafia. Need someone dead? Something covered up? Just ask us in the dark corridor next to the Mayor’s office.” Why on earth would Jeremiah have something like this?
- Jeremiah's Will | [if {inventory.will}]
	“My dear family” blah blah blah, “to my dear Jiminy I leave” blah blah blah, “To my grandfather I leave $200. Use it wisely.” Why would someone so old be in the will of someone so young? Did he know something would happen?

	[text_input text="It’s locked by a 3 digit code." var="Answer"]
	if {Answer} == "162":
		set {journal_unlocked} = true
		*click*
		The Journal unlocked!
		It reads\: “I know what I have to do now. It’s time to break into the 👍👆🖐👉👈🕯💧 👎☀️✌️♐️👉☀️. I know I’m onto something, and that office drawer should contain all the rest of the evidence I need to bring them to justice.” I never liked how he covered up important details with a series of emojis.
	else:
		Nope, that wasn't it.
- Invitation | [if {inventory.handcuffs} == true]
	It looks like an invitation. “Dear Jeremiah Jilikers, You have been invited by the Martian Mafia to a getaway on Rigel 7. Bottles will be spun, gossip will be shared, and fine art by yours truly will be auctioned.”
- Paint Tube | [if {inventory.paint}]
	Ambitious Amber
- Handcuffs | [if {inventory.handcuffs} == true]
	if {journal_unlocked} and {inventory.painting}:
		I have enough evidence. Now I have to find the culprit before the shuttle leaves.
	else:
		I'll use these when I have enough evidence.
- Painting | [if {inventory.painting} == true]
	Signed “Vincent van Mafia.” It’s pretty mid.
- Key | [if {inventory.key} == true]
	A key, presumably used by the police.
